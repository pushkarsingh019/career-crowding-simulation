# How to win the game (and life..)

The main premise of mimetic theory is that since there is no biological basis to determine what we should desire and want, we end up imitating others. Now since everyone is imitating each other and running behind the same things, this creates conflict. As more and more people are running behind the same limited resources. 

This causes everyone to get a lesser piece of the pie.

To win this game and in-part life, you have to make decisions which help you differentiate from the crowd. In this game, all you had to do to win was to make choices that were chosen the least by other people.

The more unique you are, the more chances of winning you get.
